The `hue` hub component must be added before you can use the `hue` sensors platform. Note that you must have the file `phue.conf` in your Home-assistant configuration directory, but this will have been created already if you are using the Hue lights component.

To use this component, add the following to your configuration.yaml file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
hue_sensor:
```
